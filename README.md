# kickstarter-analysis
Module 1 challenge
## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to look into the theaters outcomes based on launched date and if revenue goal was met.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By looking at graph of "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date", I am able to interpret the amounts on a monthly basis by each outcome categorized as "successful", "failed" or "cancelled" and exam its trend of changes overtime.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

After redefined and grouping the goals aiming at "theater/play" category, the chart of "Outcomes Based on Goal" is to help visualize whether a trend of outcome is reached with its difference based within the goal range. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1. When converting the time to a readable format using Epoch converter, there are limited allowance of data that can be coverted in one time. Therefore, it is challenging for me to get the date format conversion in one shot. 
2. I also found myself is not competent and savvy enough to apply "COUNTIFS" function successfully at once; it took sometime for me to fix the formula and get the numbers correct. 

## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. It is found that there are most successful outcomes in May. 
2. Amounts of successful outcome are greater than failed in each month. 

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. Highest percentage of failed outcome and lowest percentage of successful oucomes based on goals for theater/play fall under same goal range of "45000 to 49999".
2. On the other hand, lowest percentage of failed outcome and heighest percentage of successful oucome fall into the goal category of "less than 1000". 

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?

There is a currency column in this dataset and the currency category is not in uniform. When redifining the range of goal, it is unclear that the same currency unit has been applied. If not, the interpretation of based on regrouped goal range would become incorrect.  

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. Further analysis can be done based on the legnth of launch time crosswalked with outcome and goals in a line graph. 
2. Visulizing by each subcategory for goal and outcomes in bar charts can identify the most and least successful program subcategory.
